# RCT_Analysis
Analyzed the influence of behavioral factors on energy consumption through a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). 
The study evaluated interventions like personalized feedback, goal-setting, and social comparisons to encourage energy-saving behaviors. 
Results demonstrated significant changes in consumption patterns, highlighting the role of behavioral nudges in promoting sustainability. 
Findings can guide energy providers and policymakers in designing effective strategies for demand-side management, improving energy efficiency, and supporting environmental goals.
This project is more theoretical than practical. Nevertheless, in the folder you will find the R file with the code for calculating some indicators, and a PDF dedicated to a presentation of the project with accompanying considerations and sources.
